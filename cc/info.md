 I've created 5 comprehensive preparation documents:

  ðŸ“š Study Materials Created:

  1. data-structures-algorithms.md - Complete DS&A implementations with TypeScript
  2. coding-patterns.md - 12 essential patterns (Two Pointers, Sliding Window, DP, etc.)
  3. time-space-complexity.md - Big O analysis and optimization guide
  4. practice-problems.md - 20 problems (Easy/Medium/Hard) with solutions
  5. coding-interview-tips.md - UMPIRE method, communication strategies, debugging tips

  âš¡ Quick Study Plan:

  If you have 30 minutes:
  1. Review coding-patterns.md (10 min) - Focus on patterns 1-5
  2. Practice 2-3 Easy problems from practice-problems.md (15 min)
  3. Review coding-interview-tips.md UMPIRE method (5 min)

  If you have 2 hours:
  1. Review all patterns in coding-patterns.md (30 min)
  2. Solve 5 Easy + 3 Medium problems (60 min)
  3. Study time-space-complexity.md (20 min)
  4. Review interview tips and strategies (10 min)

  ðŸŽ¯ Key Areas to Focus On:

  Most Common Patterns:
  - Arrays & Strings (Two Pointers, Sliding Window)
  - Hash Maps for O(1) lookups
  - Tree/Graph traversals (BFS/DFS)
  - Dynamic Programming basics
  - Binary Search variations

  Most Asked Problems:
  - Two Sum, Valid Palindrome
  - Valid Parentheses, Merge Intervals
  - Binary Tree traversals
  - Longest Substring Without Repeating
  - Maximum Subarray (Kadane's)

  ðŸ’¡ Quick Tips for Turing Challenges:

  1. Always clarify constraints and edge cases
  2. Start with brute force, then optimize
  3. Test with examples before submitting
  4. State complexity after solving
  5. Use meaningful variable names

  ðŸš€ 30-Second Reminders:

  // Always handle edge cases first
  if (!input || input.length === 0) return [];

  // Common time complexities to achieve:
  // O(n) - Use hash maps, two pointers
  // O(n log n) - Sort first if it helps
  // O(log n) - Binary search on sorted data

  // Test with: [], [1], duplicates, negatives

  Good luck with your Turing.com coding challenge! The materials cover everything typically asked. Focus on
  understanding patterns rather than memorizing solutions.
